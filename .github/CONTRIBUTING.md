# Contributing

We welcome contributions of any size or complexity ‚≠êÔ∏è to this project, please dive right in üéâ !

## How to contribute

Start out by saying hi üëã. If you plan to contribute towards an existing issue, feel free to comment in that issue,
the Relay team will be super excited to hear from you! You could also [join the Relay community](#community) ‚ù§Ô∏è.

If there's no existing issue for your contribution, [creating an issue](https://github.com/relaycc/receiver/issues/new/choose) for it would be a great idea. Doing so will help us align on what should be implemented and avoid rework. That said, if you're just itching to write some code, go for it! The Relay team can create an issue for you if necessary.

### GitPOAP

Relay's projects support [GitPOAP](https://www.gitpoap.io/). After your pull request is merged, you can mint an [NFT](https://www.gitpoap.io/gitpoaps) that [showcases your contributions](https://www.gitpoap.io/p/0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045)!.

### Code contributions üöÄ

If you would like to contribute code, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the project.
2. Create a new branch for your changes (please use a description branch name using [kebab-case](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11273282/whats-the-name-for-hyphen-separated-case/12273101#12273101)).
3. Make your changes. Please ensure that your code follows the [style guide](#style-guide).
4. Write tests and run the test suite to ensure that [all tests pass](#tests).
5. Submit a [pull request](#pull-requests).


### Style Guide üåà

The Relay TypeScript style guide is forthcoming. For now, please make sure that your changesets are free of linter and formatter errors.

### Tests ü¶æ

The Receiver test suite using [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) is coming soon. The test priorities are:

1. API (integration) tests
2. UI tests

### Pull Requests

NB: We use "changeset" to mean "the set of code changes included in a PR".

A top-notch ü¶Ñ pull request will include:

* References to all targeted issues (do not use `closes #N` syntax, issues will be
  closed manually).
* A summary for each logical change in the changeset. If any of the changesets
  include anything weird, include descriptions of those things.
* A description of what was tested and how.
* A map for the reviewer: where to start, what to look out for, etc.
* If the changeset includes UI changes, the PR must include comprehensive
  screenshots and/or videos of the new UI.
* A "not included" section that calls out any item from any of the targeted
  issues that is not done yet. If this section contains any items, then a
  partially-completed task list must be added to the relevant issues.
* Bonus points üéâ: include a video walkthrough of the PR üî•

### Other contributions

If you have an idea for a new feature or have found a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/relaycc/receiver/issues/new/choose) or [join the community](#community).
