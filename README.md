# Overview

**The best way to add Web3 messaging to your site!**

Relay Receiver is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) library that makes it easy to
add Web3 messaging to your website.

- ðŸ”¥ Out-of-the-box wallet-to-wallet messaging
- âœ… Easily customizable, with nice defaults.
- ðŸ¦„ Built on top of [XMTP](https://xmtp.com)

## Installation

```
# with npm
npm install @relay-network/receiver
# with yarn
yarn add @relay-network/receiver
```

## Basic Usage

First, wrap your application in the `<Receiver />` context provider. For example:

```TypeScript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import { Receiver } from '@relay-network/receiver';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Receiver>
      <App />
    </Receiver>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

Next, provide the user's connected wallet to Receiver. The wallet is
used to sign in to the XMTP messaging network. How to access the connected
wallet depends on how your application implements wallet connection. Here's
an example using the popular [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) library.

_This code only accesses and uses the connected wallet, it assumes the steps to **connect a wallet** are already implemented. If you'd like to learn more, [here's a great place to start](https://wagmi.sh/docs/getting-started)._

```TypeScript
import { useSigner } from 'wagmi';
import { useWallet } from '@relay-network/receiver';

function MyWalletComponent() {
  // Access the user's connected wallet.
  const signer = useSigner();
  const [wallet, setWallet] = useWallet();

  useEffect(() => {
    // When the user's connected wallet updates, use setWallet to provide
    // the updated wallet to Receiver
    setWallet(signer.data || null)
  }, [signer.data])

  ...
}

export default App;
```

Now you're ready to add the Receiver components. The default configuration adds Receiver as an intercom-style messaging widget. To implement
this configuration, add `<Intercom />`, `<Window />` and `<Launcher />` to your app.

```TypeScript
import { Intercom, Window, Launcher } from '@relay-network/receiver';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      ...
      <Launcher />
      <Intercom>
        <Window />
      </Intercom>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Launch Directly to a Conversation

The `<Launcher />` component, when clicked, will by default open a Receiver `<Window />` with the inbox view
active. To instead jump directly into a 1:1 conversation with a specific wallet (the site's support team, for example),
you can pass in the `peerAddress` prop:

```TypeScript
import { Intercom, Window, Launcher } from '@relay-network/receiver';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Intercom>
        <Window />
      </Intercom>
      <Launcher peerAddress={'0x1800TECHSUPPORT'} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Custom Launch Button

You can also use the `useLaunch` hook to turn any component into a Receiver launcher:

```TypeScript
import { Intercom, Window, useLaunch } from '@relay-network/receiver';

function App() {
  const launch = useLaunch();
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Intercom>
        <Window />
      </Intercom>
      <button onClick={() => launch()}>
        Open Conversations List
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => launch('0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045')}>
        Talk to Vitalik
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Custom Positioning

The `<Intercom />` component is just a utility component that positions the Receiver
window and applies nice default transitions to opening and closing the window.
This means that the `<Window />` component can be positioned anywhere you like.
For example, you could center it:

```TypeScript
import { Window, Launcher } from '@relay-network/receiver';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div className="overlay">
        <Window />
        <Launcher />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```css
/* App.css */
.overlay {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  top: 0;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## Custom CSS

The `<Window />` component accepts a `className` prop you can use to apply
custom CSS to the window. In the future, we will provide fine-grained access to
various components. For now, the `className` prop will work best for applying
basic styling like a border, box-shadow, or custom positioning.

```css
/* App.css */
.bordered {
  border: 3px solid black;
}
```

```TypeScript
<Window className="bordered">
```
